# EYE_ROTATION
## Description

In JavaScript, events are actions that happen on a web page. They can be anything from a mouse moving to a user typing in some text. Events happen to most elements on the DOM. These events are a good way to bind a code to user actions. For example, consider a web page that has a form with a "Submit" button. You can bind the mouse button click to that button and submit the form data upon that click.
